        <h2>Dear Sir,</h2>

        <p>As a caveat, I'm very much a watch novice, but here's the lay of the land as I understand it--I'm not promising that it's 100% correct, but it should be more or less correct.  Please note that all prices are ballparked and inexact; however, they should be roughly accurate.  Finally, as always, I'm painting with a broad brush here--based on what I have read on the internet.  I have not conducted extensive polling data, nor do I claim that all people of a certain demographic will act in the exact same fashion.  Rather, I'm going to speak in broad generalizations:</p>

        <h3>Basics</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>A watch is your only accessory aside from cufflinks and a wedding ring, so it's worth spending some money on one if you can afford it AND will appreciate it.</li>
          <li>No matter what you buy, make sure you love it, because it will probably be on your wrist 5-7 days per week.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Aesthetics</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>In terms of aesthetics, there are two types of watches: sport watches and dress watches.</li>
          <li>Sport watches (eg: Rolex Submariner) are busier and bulkier: they have thicker hands, a thicker case and bezel, and perhaps glow-in-the-dark dots and hands to hep you see at night.  They are more likely to have multiple dials.  They may be waterproof up to hundreds of meters.  They are more likely to have metal or rubber watchbands.  They work best with more casual clothing, from a polo shirt to a blazer without a tie.  Those that aren't too busy--like the Submariner above--can also be worn with suits.  In this sense, a dressier sport-watch is the most versatile watch one can buy.  (However, unless you are Daniel Craig, you would do well to avoid them while wearing Black Tie.)  Classic colors include: black, white, or blue face; silver bezel/case; silver metal band.</li>
          <li>Dress watches (eg: Omega Deville) are cleaner and sleeker: they have thinner hands, a thinner case and bezel, and are less likely to have multiple dials.  They are more likely to have leather bands, but many also have metal watchbands.    They are typically worn with at least business casual attire, if not a tie and jacket--you would never wear one with a short-sleeve shirt.  Most of them--so long as they are unobtrusive--can be worn with black tie.  Unsurprisingly, they are less versatile than a dressy sport watch (assuming that you wear casual attire a good portion of the time).  Classic colors include: white face; silver or gold bezel/case; brown or black leather band.</li>
          <li>Points (2) and (3) can be distilled into a single general rule: the busier the watch, the sportier the watch--the cleaner the watch, the dressier the watch.</li>
          <li>True watch aficionados have at least one dress and one sport watch.  However, given the costs I'm about to explain below, you'll probably want to settle on one versatile watch.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Quartz v. Automatic</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>In terms of construction, there are two types of watches: Quartz and Automatic.</li>
          <li>Quartz watches tell time perfectly by using a battery (or solar power) and quartz, which apparently moves at a precise frequency and tells the watch how often to tick.  The second-hand on a quartz watch should always tick--it will never constantly sweep.   Nice ones can be had new for \.  Quartz watches almost never require service, aside from the occasionally battery replacement.  Expected service costs are probably \ every 5 years (assuming one major repair per five years).</li>
          <li>Automatic watches typically lose several seconds per day and thus need to be reset each morning, but they are works of artisan craftsmanship: a precision instrument of finely tuned gears that is product of man's mind and hard work.  The second-hand should continuously sweep around the face at a constant rate.  A new automatic--the kind worth buying, anway--starts at \k (with one exception).  Vintage ones can be had for less.  Automatics need to be serviced every 2-3 years by a professional, which can be expensive.  Expected service costs are \ every 5 years.  (assuming one servicing per 2.5 years, at \ per servicing).</li>
          <li>Sophisticated rich people understand craftsmanship, and thus buy automatics.  Regular rich people understand that automatics are nice things but don't know why; they too buy automatics.</li>
          <li>People who can't afford a several-thousand dollar watch--or down-home types who think that expensive watches are a waste of money (remember those midwesterners I asked you about?)--buy quartz.</li>
          <li>Assuming that you want to impress rich people AND will appreciate it AND are willing to part with a few grand or more, I will limit the remainder of my piece to automatic watches only.  (If you only want to spend a few hundred bucks, go buy a Seiko or Citizen in classic dress watch colors: white face; gold or silver bezel; brown or black leather strap.  It will serve you well as a quiet and coherent part of any business outfit, even if no one ever comments on it).</li>
          <li>A final reason to buy an automatic watch: automatics generally maintain the majority of their value, so you can buy one and later resell it.  You can alternatively pass it on to your son or grandson.  An heirloom timepiece is the sort of gift that money can't buy--the kind that establishes that your children are not dirty arrivistes.  Having said that, an automatic from an actual watchmaker (see below) is more likely to hold its value than a watchmaker from a fashion brand (see below).</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Automatic Watches</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Among automatic watches, we have two different types of watch manufacturers: fashion brands and actual watchmakers.</li>
          <li>Actual watchmakers are almost always Swiss and typically have been making watches since the 19th century.  They generally make their own movements--the mechanism of gears that constitutes the heart of the watch--and typically produce the entire watch in Switzerland.  (Oddly enough, several of these "small" houses are now are owned by the massive Swatch Group.)  These watchmakers, regardless of size, are true artisans, and this is the appeal.  As you can imagine, this is why the watches in question are so expensive.  Examples include: Omega (\k+); Rolex (\k); IWC (\k+); Panerai (\k+); Audemars Piaget (\k); Patek Phillipe (\k+).</li>
          <li>Fashion brands typically use an ETA movements, cheaper Swiss movements produced by the low-cost Swiss movement juggernaught, ETA (also owned by the Swatch Group).  The fashion brand takes this pre-made movement--the heart of the watch--and designs the case and all of the aesthetics.  Sometimes, these fashion brand watches are made in cheaper labor areas (eg: SE Asia) in order to increase profit margins.  In this sense, the fashion brand watch is more of a fashion piece than a tribute to the decades of craftsmanship of a "small" Swiss watchmaker (whatever you think of that idea).  Fashion brands also charge a premium for the brand: you're paying for the name and the brand's exclusive aesthetic choices, rather than just a more expensive movement and high Swiss production costs.  Examples include: any well-known brand you've ever heard of (eg: Armani) that is selling a watch.  (In addition, because most of these brands need to target the masses, they need to sell cheaper watches, so many fashion brand watches are quartz, which means they're non-starters anyway.)</li>
          <li>There are exceptions to this rule: some of the traditional Swiss watchmakers use ETA movements for some of their less expensive watches to make them more accessible, such as the entry-level Omega Seamaster (\k+).  Conversely, Cartier's watches--though Cartier is a fashion house--are well-respected on the level of a traditional Swiss watchmaker, and they too use ETA movements.  This is not to say that Cartier or Omega Seamasters are not great watches--ETA movements are very good, but they lack the pedigree of in-house movements.</li>
          <li>Also, you will probably want to avoid once-great watchmakers who are now considered somewhat tainted because they rely on ETA movements, lower cost production, and a lower pricepoint.  This includes Longines (\k+) and Tag Heur (\k+).  These storied watchmakers are now--like many other makers--owned by the Swatch Group (which, as explained above, is not always bad).  In these cases though, the quality of the watch has somewhat suffered, and the pedigree has suffered to a much greater degree.  You won't get nearly the same props from the rich or sophisticated rich for a Tag (though you might from Longines).  In any case, when you can get an Omega or Rolex for a few grand more, you may as well go all the way.  No reason to half-ass it for less than half-credit.  As a general rule, I would avoid any new watch with an MSRP below \k.</li>
          <li>The final exception is Seiko, the Japanese watch behemoth. In America, Seikos are associated with inexpensive and unremarkable quartz watches.  In other markets--such as Japan--Seiko makes all manner of automatic watches.  To my knowledge, they all use their own in-house movements.  To watch connoisseurs with an eye for value--including the sophisticated rich--a Seiko automatic can be an interesting and legitimate choice.  They start at \k and go up to \k+.  (As an automatic alternative to a quartz, you could also get a Seiko 5 for a few hundred dollars, if your budget is tight).</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Regular Rich People v. Sophisticated Rich People</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>As explained above, sophisticated rich people appreciate the craftsmanship of an automatic, while regular rich people just care that the watch is expensive.</li>
          <li>Regular rich people, who account for the vast majority of rich people in America, will appreciate almost any expensive watch from a Swiss watchmaker: Omega; Rolex; IWC; Patek-Phillipe, etc.  They will probably be most impressed with Omegas and Rolexes, because those are the best-known makers.  However, if you are wearing a lesser-known but expensive Swiss maker, they'll still be very impressed.  In addition, they might even appreciate certain fashion brands, such as Mont Blanc (of fountain pen fame).  They are less likely to appreciate obvious fashion brands such as Hugo Boss.  Without further explanation, they are unlikely to appreciate a Seiko of any flavor, though they may appreciate a Longines or even a Tag, given the brand.</li>
          <li>Sophisticated rich people, who account for a small minority of rich people in America, will similarly appreciate almost any expensive watch from a Swiss watchmaker.  However, unlike the regular rich, who give more credence to Rolex and Omega because they are well-known, sophisticated rich people tend to shy away from the better known Swiss makers.  This includes not only Omega and Rolex, but also the now-tainted lower-end Swiss makers, such as Tag, and perhaps even Longines.  Obviously, the sophisticated rich will typically be unimpressed with fashion brands.  If regular people have heard of it, they probably don't want it.  To that end, the sophisticated rich may also appreciate a Seiko.  Finally, please note that the sophisticated rich will still appreciate the Rolex/Omega--they'll just think that you aren't yet in the know.  They may even enjoy introducing you to the land of more-expensive-than-Rolexes.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Final Recommendations</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Dress v. Sport: If you want a nice watch to wear casually as well as formally, get a dressier sport watch.  If you want a nice watch that you envision wearing only formally but is more sophisticated, get a dress watch.</li>
          <li>Quartz v. Automatic: If you don't want to spend more than \, just get a quartz watch in classic colors (see above).  You'll never impress anyone, but you'll also never lose points, because it's a classic look.  (This is the essence of playing to tie the game.)  Otherwise, get an automatic if you can afford it.</li>
          <li>Fashion Brands: Do not buy them.  Not worth it because they don't keep their value as well and they don't impress nearly as many rich people.</li>
          <li>Rich People: If you don't want to spend more than 5k, get an Omega/Rolex. It'll impress the regular rich, and the sophisticated rich won't look down on you.  If you want to spend more than 5k, consider upgrading to something more expensive (and obviously Swiss): it'll impress the regular rich and sophisticated rich alike.  Also, you wont' be like everyone else with a Rolex.</li>
          <li>Seikos: consider investing in one of these if you're looking for something a little less expensive and off the beaten path.  (Again, the Seiko 5 series is an incredible value play, and the other automatics are very nice as well--just not well known.  Yes, regular rich people will probably look down on you until you explain).</li>
          <li>Buying: online sellers are dangerous.  You'll need to figure out which are not selling fakes if you want to use one.  The best recommendation is to find a licensed dealer and buy from them.  If you are serious about the watch, you should be able to get at least 10% off the MSRP if you buy in store (maybe even 15-20%.)  Paying cash would probably help.</li>
          <li>Vintage: This is another option, which allows you to get a nice watch at a better price than a new watch. However, you get what you pay for: there are plenty of fakes out there, and you rarely know how much the watch has been serviced.  A watch can look awesome in a picture but tell horrible time.  As you can imagine, this is a mixed bag.  If done right, it's quite affordable.</li>
          <li>Buy what you love: A good automatic is a major investment (probably \k+).  You'll presumably have this watch for a long time.  So make it count.  By something you love.  You don't want to have buyer's remorse on \k of watch.  Even if you can resell for 60% of what you paid, that's still a \k mistake.  So take your time, and buy something you truly love.</li>
